**StayFresh** is an AI powered mobile app that automatically scans grocery receipts and makes managing food expiration dates a breeze, preventing any food waste and saving money. Users can simply scan their receipts and the AI will detect the food items and generate expiry date based on the items shelf life. The app makes it easy to track these food items, receive timely reminders, and generate recipe ideas for soon-to-expire items or items of users choice so they donâ€™t go to waste.

Its ideal for budget-conscious individuals, Stay Fresh guarantees savings while minimizing food waste. The app was inspired by our own experience struggling to make use of everything we buy and the current cost of living crisis. After some research we discovered that the UK thows away 9.5 Million tons of food every year so we felt like this app would be a great way to help combat this.
